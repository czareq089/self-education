# My Learning Path

## Introduction

During my time in school, I encountered several difficulties and struggled to understand programming concepts. Despite my interest in technology, the traditional educational approach didn't fully resonate with me.

## Decision to Start Learning to Code Myself

Realizing the importance of programming skills and my coding interests, I made the decision to take charge of my learning journey. I sought out various resources and embarked on a self-directed path to learn coding.

## Resources I use and projects I do

- **https://www.freecodecamp.org/news for courses**
- **https://www.w3schools.com/**
  and
- **https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/  for more practical knowledge**


- **Practical Projects**: I'm working on small projects to apply what I learned and gain practical experience. Building simple websites and experimenting with basic programming languages like JavaScript help me understand coding better.

## Plans for the Future

### Web Development

- **Frontend Technologies**: I aim to learn more about JavaScript.

- **Backend Development**: Understanding backend technologies like Express.js, and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.

- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Learning popular frameworks like React and Svelte.

### Rust Programming Language

- **Exploring Rust**: Intrigued by its performance, safety, and concurrency features, I plan to learn Rust.

- **Building Projects**: I intend to build projects in Rust like apps and games to practice.

## Conclusion

My learning journey in programming has just begun, and I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. By embracing self-directed learning and remaining persistent, I'm confident in my ability to achieve my goals.
